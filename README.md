# Intro

EKS Rolling Update is a utility for updating the launch configuration or template of worker nodes in an EKS cluster. It
updates worker nodes in a rolling fashion and performs health checks of your EKS cluster to ensure no disruption to service.
To achieve this, it performs the following actions:

* Pauses Kubernetes Autoscaler (Optional)
* Finds a list of worker nodes that do not have a launch config or template that matches their ASG
* Scales up the desired capacity
* Ensures the ASGs are healthy and that the new nodes have joined the EKS cluster
* Cordons the outdated worker nodes
* Suspends AWS Autoscaling actions while update is in progress
* Drains outdated EKS outdated worker nodes one by one
* Terminates EC2 instances of the worker nodes one by one
* Detaches EC2 instances from the ASG one by one
* Scales down the ASG to original count (in case of failure)
* Resumes AWS Autoscaling actions
* Resumes Kubernetes Autoscaler (Optional)

### K8S Node & Pod Controls

| Environment Variable       | Description                                                                                                                | Default                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| K8S_AUTOSCALER_ENABLED     | If True Kubernetes Autoscaler will be paused before running update                                                         | False                                    |
| K8S_AUTOSCALER_NAMESPACE   | Namespace where Kubernetes Autoscaler is deployed                                                                          | default                                  |

| TAINT_NODES                | Replace the default **cordon**-before-drain strategy with `NoSchedule` **taint**ing, as a workaround for K8S < `1.19` [prematurely removing cordoned nodes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/65013) from `Service`-managed `LoadBalancer`s | False |
| EXTRA_DRAIN_ARGS           | Additional space-delimited args to supply to the `kubectl drain` function, e.g `--force=true`. See `kubectl drain -h`      | ""                                       |
| ENFORCED_DRAINING          | If draining fails for a node due to corrupted `PodDisruptionBudget`s or failing pods, retry draining with `--disable-eviction=true` and `--force=true` for this node to prevent aborting the script. This is useful to get the rolling update done in development and testing environments and **should not be used in productive environments** since this will bypass checking `PodDisruptionBudget`s | False |

## Run Modes

There are a number of different values which can be set for the `RUN_MODE` environment variable.

`1` is the default.

| Mode Number   | Description                                                                                                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1             | Scale up and cordon/taint the outdated nodes of each ASG one-by-one, just before we drain them.                       |
| 2             | Scale up and cordon/taint the outdated nodes of all ASGs all at once at the beginning of the run.                     |
| 3             | Cordon/taint the outdated nodes of all ASGs at the beginning of the run but scale each ASG one-by-one.                |
| 4             | Roll EKS nodes based on age instead of launch config (works with `MAX_ALLOWABLE_NODE_AGE` with default 6 days value). |

Each of them have different advantages and disadvantages.
* Scaling up all ASGs at once may cause AWS EC2 instance limits to be exceeded
* Only cordoning the nodes on a per-ASG basis will mean that pods are likely to be moved more than once
* Cordoning the nodes for all ASGs at once could cause issues if new pods needs to start during the process

## Batching

EKS Rolling Update can batch scale-out the ASG to progressively reach the desired instance count before it begins
draining the nodes.

This is intended for use in cases where a large ASG scale-out may result in instances failing to register with
EKS. Such a scenario is more likely to occur with larger ASGs where (for example) a 100 instance ASG may be asked
to scale to 200 (temporarily). Users may find that some instances never register, and this causes EKS Rolling
Update to hang indefinitely waiting for the registered EKS node count to match the instance count.

If this happens, you may want to consider batching.

For example, if the ASG will be scaled from 100 instances to 200 instances, specifying a batch size of 10 will
result in the ASG first scaling to 110, then 120, 130, etc instances until 200 is reached. Once the desired
count is reached, the tool will proceed with the normal draining/scale-in operations.

## Examples

* Plan

```
$ python eks_rolling_update.py --cluster_name YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME --plan
```

* Apply Changes

```
$ python eks_rolling_update.py --cluster_name YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME
```

* Cluster Autoscaler

If using `cluster-autoscaler`, you must let `eks-rolling-update` know that cluster-autoscaler is running in your cluster by exporting the following environment variables:

```
$ export  K8S_AUTOSCALER_ENABLED=true \
          K8S_AUTOSCALER_NAMESPACE="${CA_NAMESPACE}" \
          K8S_AUTOSCALER_DEPLOYMENT="${CA_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}"
```

* Disable operations on `cluster-autoscaler`

```
$ unset K8S_AUTOSCALER_ENABLED
```

* Configure tool via `.env` file

Rather than using environment variables, you can use a `.env` file within your working directory to load
updater settings. e.g:

```
$ cat .env
DRY_RUN=1
```
